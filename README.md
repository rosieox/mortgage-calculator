# mortgage-calculator

Super simple streamlit app.

My partner and I are trying to buy a house. I would like to figure out what our monthly mortgage repayments would be given the value of the house, the size of our combined deposit, the length of the loan and the current average interest rates (around 5% just now).

I would also like to know how much we'll end up paying back in interest.
